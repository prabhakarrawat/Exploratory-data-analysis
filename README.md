Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and analyzing data to understand its main characteristics, patterns, and relationships. The goal of EDA is to develop a deeper understanding of the data, detect anomalies or outliers, and identify trends and patterns that may be hidden in the data. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process, as it helps to inform subsequent data modeling and hypothesis testing. Through EDA, we can develop a better understanding of the data and make informed decisions about how to analyze it. The ultimate goal of EDA is to help us gain a deeper understanding of the data and uncover insights that can be used to inform decision-making or further analysis.

The process of EDA typically involves following steps:
1. Downloading a dataset from online source
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Data analysis and visualization
4. Asking interesting questions and answering
5. Conclusion
